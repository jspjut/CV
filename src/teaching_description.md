I am a computer generalist and educator with experience in game development, graphics architecture, and embedded systems.
My interests in human relationships and human computer interfacing have led me to esports research most recently.
In teaching, I believe solid foundations are essential, and that modern tools, like generative AI, should be applied whenever possible.
