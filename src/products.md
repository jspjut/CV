**NVIDIA Experiments Mode - KovaaK's**

In collaboration with The Meta, we deployed an experiment mode in the [KovaaK's FPS Aim Trainer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/824270/KovaaKs/) and have released multiple experiments. The following is a list of released experiments so far.

* February 2021: Target Color Experiment
* February 2021: Render Resolution Experiment
* December 2021: System Latency Challenge


**NVIDIA Reflex Esports Performance Platform**

In Fall 2018, I started a new research effort on esports with others at NVIDIA. We re-discovered through user studies that for first person aiming, computer system latency is important for maximum player performance. Working with product teams across the company, this led to the launch of the Reflex Esports Performance Platform including many products, such as the Reflex Latency Analyzer (RLA) that I co-invented released in 2020. [NVIDIA Reflex Platform](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/reflex-low-latency-platform/). RLA monitors continue to be released regularly, including many more announced in 2021 and 2022.


**RTXGI**

Research on probe-based global illumination ([DDGI](https://morgan3d.github.io/articles/2019-04-01-ddgi/)) from Zander Majercik and Morgan McGuire led to the development and release of the [RTXGI SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/rtxgi) providing a probe-based global illumination implementation suitable for use in real time games and applications. Adam Marrs led the product efforts and I got the opportunity to do the SDK implementation of probe relocation and classification leading up to the first public release. This SDK will be used in a number of upcoming video games.


**Ray Tracing Cores - Turing**

The first product my research was involved in was the ray tracing cores included in NVIDIA GPUs starting with the Turing architecture released first as the Quadro RTX series and the GeForce RTX 20 series. This hardware represents the culmination of at least 20 years of research across the industry, including my PhD research and my first 2 years of work for NVIDIA. My work at NVIDIA included power and performance simulation and architectural design space exploration. [Turing Architecture White Paper](https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/design-visualization/technologies/turing-architecture/NVIDIA-Turing-Architecture-Whitepaper.pdf). RT Cores continue to be a major selling point of NVIDIA GPUs and have caused competitors, including AMD and Intel to add similar ray tracing support to their GPUs as well.
