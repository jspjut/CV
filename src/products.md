## Products

**NVIDIA Reflex Esports Performance Platform**

In Fall 2018, I started a new research effort on esports with others at NVIDIA. We discovered through user studies that for first person aiming, computer system latency is important for maximum player performance. Working with product teams across the company, this led to the launch of the Reflex Esports Performance Platform including many products, such as the Reflex Latency Analyzer that I co-invented released in 2020.

**RTXGI**

Research on probe-based global illumination ([DDGI](https://morgan3d.github.io/articles/2019-04-01-ddgi/)) from Zander Majercik and Morgan McGuire led to the development and release of the [RTXGI SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/rtxgi) providing a probe-based global illumination implementation suitable for use in real time games and applications. I got the opportunity to do the SDK implementation of probe relocation and classification leading up to the first public release. This SDK will be used in a number of upcoming video game releases.


**Ray Tracing Cores - Turing**

The first product my research was involved in was the ray tracing cores included in NVIDIA GPUs starting with the Turing architecture released first as the Quadro RTX series and the GeForce RTX 20 series. This hardware represents the culmination of at least 20 years of research across the industry, including my PhD research and my first 2 years of work for NVIDIA. My work at NVIDIA included power and performance simulation and architectural design space exploration.
