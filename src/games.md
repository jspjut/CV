## Game Projects

**First Person Science**

As part of our research efforts to study FPS aiming, I led development and maintenance of First Person Science, a stripped down first person shooter game for conducting human performance studies. After successfully completing our initial experiments in early 2019, we release regular updates on github to support further academic study. ([Source code](https://github.com/NVlabs/abstract-fps) and [releases](https://github.com/NVlabs/abstract-fps/releases) available on github.)


**Wizard Fight Race**

Led a group of four contributors in developing a game from scratch
using the Unity game engine. The 4 of us built the game in 72 hours in March 2012. (Read more

**PyGauntlet Open Source Game**

PyGauntlet is a game project in Python from an undergraduate software
engineering course where a group of 7 students developed a game over 8
weeks in 2006. After the course finished, I took over the lead of it and
obtained permission to release the source code and continue
development. I added an OpenGL based renderer to the engine and
introduced engine optimizations to allow the game to run well even on
slower processors. (Source code available at
