## Game Projects

**Wizard Fight Race**

Led a group of four contributors in developing a game from scratch
using the Unity game engine. This project was meant to see what a
group of relatively inexperienced developers could do in comparison to
other 72-hour game development projects that more well-established
game developers participate in. (Executable downloads available at

**PyGauntlet Open Source Game**

PyGauntlet is a game project in Python from an undergraduate software
engineering course where a group of 7 students developed a game over 8
weeks. After the course finished, I took over the lead of it and
obtained permission to release the source code and continue
development. I added an OpenGL based renderer to the engine and
introduced engine optimizations to allow the game to run well even on
slower processors. (Source code available at
